*The Canvas Hub is still under development.*

The [Canvas Hub](https://canvas-hub.fly.dev/) is a pinning service for
Canvas applications. It connects to the P2P network for each
application, acting as a hosted peer and serving applications'
API and database, for developers who prefer not to serve data to their
users directly.

The hub makes it easy to launch a Canvas application while ensuring
your users' data is safely managed and backed up.
