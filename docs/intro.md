# Introduction

***Canvas is early-stage software, and this documentation may be
   out of date.***

Canvas is a new architecture for decentralized applications,
where user interactions are signed messages, synchronized over a P2P
network.

For developers, we provide an easy-to-use data store like Heroku
or Postgres, where most application backends can be expressed in <50
lines of code.

For users, interacting with Canvas applications is fast and free, with
zero fees and minimal latency.

Rather than using a blockchain to establish consensus for every
action, Canvas applications' state is generated by replaying the
effects of signed messages, using approaches inspired by
[CRDTs](https://crdt.tech/) and [client-side
prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side_prediction).
Unlike broadcast protocols like libp2p, Canvas also synchronizes
the history of applications, so if you clone an application from Github,
its data will sync along with it.


## Using Canvas

Each application is a unique file or "contract", pinned to
IPFS, that defines **models, routes, and actions**.

Anyone can run the application with `canvas run <contract.js>` or
`canvas run <multihash>`. This launches an API for the application, and
if you have peering enabled, starts automatic sync with existing
nodes on the network.

From the frontend, users login to the app with a wallet like
Metamask, by signing a temporary key stored in the browser. We
currently provide [React
hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@canvas-js/hooks) for doing this,
and we're working on close integrations with Next.js and Webpack, so
you can run a full-stack Canvas app with one command!


## Demo

These Canvas applications are each deployed from a single Github repository, deployed
to Fly.io containers:

* [canvas-chat.fly.dev](https://canvas-chat.fly.dev/index.html) uses Webpack
* [canvas-chat-2.fly.dev](https://canvas-chat-2.fly.dev) uses Next.js
* Also run Canvas locally by downloading the
  [webpack app](https://github.com/canvasxyz/canvas/tree/main/packages/example-chat)
  or [next app](https://github.com/canvasxyz/canvas/tree/main/packages/example-chat-next)
  and running `npm run start`. Data should sync automatically with the online instances.


## Recommended uses

* Community software (chat, forums, governance tools)
* Knowledge tools (Q&A, notes, ratings, reviews)
* Modular applications (widgets, app stores)
* ZK social applications and game worlds
* Other lightweight decentralized applications anchored on L2s
