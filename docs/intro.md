# Introduction

Canvas is an efficient and minimalist peer-to-peer computer, with an architecture that resembles IPFS and BitTorrent. We use signed messages, peer-to-peer networking, and CRDTs, to make it possible to build decentralized apps without a cryptocurrency.

Each Canvas application is a unique file that defines a *decentralized backend*, a set of models, routes, and actions, with the option to read from data sources like certificate authorities or blockchains.

Interactions with the application are *signed messages*, which can be generated by anyone with a valid public key. Messages are exchanged over a peer-to-peer network that efficiently tracks differences between different nodes' action sets, while maintaining eventual consistency.

To learn more, you can [read about the technology](./docs/about), or [deploy and run your first app in 5 minutes](./docs/tutorial/writing-a-canvas-contract).

## Using Canvas

To run an application, anyone with the offchain contract can execute `canvas run <contract.js>` from the command line. This gives you an API on port 8000 for the application. If you have peering enabled, it will also allow Canvas nodes to sync with each other over a peer-to-peer network.

From the frontend, users can "log in" to Canvas apps with a crypto wallet like Metamask, by signing a temporary session key stored in the browser, which can then write to the backend like in a traditional server-side application. We also give you [React hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@canvas-js/hooks) to make [setting this up easy](./docs/tutorial/writing-a-canvas-frontend).
