# Introduction

Canvas is a federated protocol and developer framework for building
decentralized applications, where user interactions are signed
messages synchronized over a P2P network.

For developers, we expose an easy-to-use data store like Heroku or
Postgres, which allows most application backends to be expressed in
<50 lines of code.

For users, interacting with Canvas applications is fast and free, with
zero fees and minimal latency.

Rather than using a blockchain to establish consensus for every
action, Canvas application state is generated by combining the effects
of signed messages, using an approach inspired by
[CRDTs](https://crdt.tech/) and [client-side
prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side_prediction).

Rather than only supporting messaging like most p2p broadcast
protocols (like libp2p), Canvas also synchronizes the history of
applications, so if you clone an application from Github, its data
will sync along with it.


## Using Canvas

Each application is a unique file or "contract", pinned to
IPFS, that defines **models, routes, and actions**.

Anyone can run the application with `canvas run <contract.js>` or
`canvas run <multihash>`. This launches an API for the application, and
if you have peering enabled, starts automatic sync with existing
nodes on the network.

From the frontend, users login to the app with a wallet like
Metamask, by signing a temporary key stored in the browser. We
provide [React
hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@canvas-js/hooks) for doing this,
and we're working on close integrations with Next.js and Webpack, so
you can run a full-stack Canvas app with one command.


## Demo

These Canvas applications are deployed to separate Fly.io containers, and
synchronize with each other:

* [canvas-chat.fly.dev](https://canvas-chat.fly.dev/index.html) built with Webpack
* [canvas-chat-2.fly.dev](https://canvas-chat-2.fly.dev) built with Next.js
* You can also run Canvas locally by downloading the
  [webpack app](https://github.com/canvasxyz/canvas/tree/main/packages/example-chat)
  or [next app](https://github.com/canvasxyz/canvas/tree/main/packages/example-chat-next)
  and running `npm run start`. Your local instance should sync automatically with the online instances in <60 seconds.


## Recommended uses

* Community software (chat, forums, governance tools)
* Knowledge tools (Q&A, notes, ratings, reviews)
* Modular applications (widgets, app stores)
* ZK social applications and autonomous worlds
