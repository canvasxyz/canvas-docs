title: Canvas Hub

_We're running a private alpha for the Canvas Hub right now. Please
[reach out](mailto:raymond@canvas.xyz) if you'd like to try it!_

The Canvas Hub is a pinning service and hosted peer for Canvas
applications, similar to [pinata.cloud](https://pinata.cloud). It
connects to the peer-to-peer network for your application, and serves
the API for users who prefer not to download an app's data.

The hub will make it easy to launch a Canvas application while making
sure that your users' data is safely managed and backed up.
