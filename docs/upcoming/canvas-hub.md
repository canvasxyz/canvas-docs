title: Canvas Hub
---

The [Canvas Hub](https://canvas-hub.fly.dev/) is a pinning service and
hosted peer for Canvas applications, similar to
[pinata.cloud](https://pinata.cloud). It connects to the peer-to-peer
network for your application, and serves the API for users who prefer
not to download an app's data.

The hub will make it easy to launch a Canvas application while making
sure that your users' data is safely managed and backed up.
